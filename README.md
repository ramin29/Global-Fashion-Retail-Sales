Analysis of the synthetic dataset which simulates two years of transactional data for a multinational fashion retailer.

##Project Overview

This project analyzes a synthetic transactional dataset simulating two years of sales activity for a multinational fashion retailer operating across multiple countries and cities. The goal is to derive data-driven insights that support strategic decisions in pricing, promotions, product assortment, and store performance.

The dataset represents a real-world retail environment with over 1 million transaction records and a relational structure, making it suitable for end-to-end analytics: data modeling, querying, analysis, and visualization.
